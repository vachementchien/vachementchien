- 👋 Hello Everyone _ I’m @vachementchien. I'm a Desinger (dyslexic designer), Inventor, Conceptual Futurist and Maker of Actual Things. (A.D.S. = Actually Do Shit - my acronym of choice).
- 👀 I’m interested in using Blockchain to straddle and conjoin Human + Material + Digital value systems. I call this Cyclic Economics. 
There's much talk of "circular" and the $trillions that implies in the coming decade or so. In My <not so> Humble Opinion, The word "circular" sounds like an exercise in futility from the outset. But, hey, let's not fall out over semantics!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Product Design as a way to induce widespread behavioral change, particularly as regards our relationship with the environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a highly innovative ASICS resistant cryptocurrency/token. It has a catchy name and cool graphics and I also have a web domain to show it off. I'd like help building a Team to get it ready before launching it. The idea is Butterfly Effect in nature, so I need to brainstorm it with passionate people and time it perfectly. A good level of technical know-how in blockchain, cryptography, AGI and machine learning would help.
- 📫 How to reach me ... my email is <vachementchien@gmail.com> I shall divulge other means as and when I get to know you.
